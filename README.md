# RGB-Light-Show-Arduino


This arduino file is great for testing out colors in RGB format, plug in your colors and upload to your arduino.

Challenges:
Make a variable to allow for dynamic update of time between colors, via a potentiometer, a sensor or code.

How many rgb leds can you add before the lack of current affects the color?

How would you go about adding a dozen RGB leds?

The masking tape is used to prevent the arduino from moving all over the place, some pins were covered to avoid accidental short circuits. 

With electronics one single mistake can ruin devices and components.

Feel free to add to the code, upgrades will be uploaded to share with other aduino users.

Faders, additional leds, and other type of lights like led strips should be fun too.

For those that are new to electronics and microcontrollers, ARDUINO is a microcontroller that allows you to program components creatively.

Pic for tinkercad is included in the files.
