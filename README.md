# RGB-Light-Show-Arduino

This arduino file is great for testing out colors in RGB format, plug in your colors and upload to your arduino.

Challenges:
Make a variable to allow for dynamic update of time between colors, via a potentiometer a sensor or code.

How many rgb leds can you add without the current affecting the color?

How would you go about adding a dozen leds?

The masking tape is used to prevent the arduino from moving all over the place, some pins were covered to avoid accidental short circuits. 

In electronics one single mistake can ruin devices and components.

Feel free to add to the code, upgrades will be uploaded to share with other aduino users.

Faders, additional leds, and other type of lights like led strips should be fun too.
